Analog Devices ADAU1701

Required properties:

 - compatible:		Should contain "adi,adau1701"
 - reg:			The i2c address. Value depends on the state of ADDR0
			and ADDR1, as wired in hardware.

Optional properties:

 - reset-gpio: 		A GPIO spec to define which pin is connected to the
			chip's !RESET pin. If specified, the driver will
			assert a hardware reset at probe time.

Examples:

	i2c_bus {
		adau1701@34 {
			compatible = "adi,adau1701";
			reg = <0x34>;
			reset-gpio = <&gpio 23 0>;
		};
	};
