Texas Instruments' Message Manager Driver
========================================

The Texas Instruments' Message Manager is a mailbox controller that has
configurable queues selectable at SoC(System on Chip) integration. The Message
manager is broken up into queues in different address regions that are called
"proxies" - each instance is unidirectional and is instantiated at SoC
integration level to indicate receive or transmit path.

This can also be used to describe Texas Instrument's Secure Proxy
controller that allows for individually configurable "threads" or
"proxies" which allow for independent communication scheme.

Message Manager Device Node:
===========================
Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Shall be one of: "ti,k2g-message-manager",
			"ti,am654-secure-proxy"
- reg-names 		for ti,k2g-message-manager, the following shall exist:
				queue_proxy_region - Map the queue proxy region.
				queue_state_debug_region - Map the queue state
					debug region.
			for ti,am654-secure-proxy, the following shall exist:
				target_data - Map the proxy data region
				rt - Map the realtime status region
				scfg - Map the configuration region
- reg:			Contains the register map per reg-names.
- #mbox-cells		for ti,k2g-message-manager, Shall be 2. Contains the
			queue ID and proxy ID in the following order referring
			to the transfer path:
				queue_proxy_region - Map the queue proxy region.
				queue_state_debug_region - Map the queue state
					debug region.
			for ti,am654-secure-proxy, Shall be 1 and shall refer
		        to the transfer path called thread.
- interrupt-names:	Contains interrupt names matching the rx transfer path
			for a given SoC. Receive interrupts shall be of the
			format:
			For ti,k2g-message-manager, this shall be: "rx_<QID>"
			and shall contain:
				"rx_005", "rx_057"
			for ti,am654-secure-proxy, this shall be: "rx_<PID>".
- interrupts:		Contains the interrupt information corresponding to
			interrupt-names property.

Example(K2G):
------------

	msgmgr: msgmgr@2a00000 {
		compatible = "ti,k2g-message-manager";
		#mbox-cells = <2>;
		reg-names = "queue_proxy_region", "queue_state_debug_region";
		reg = <0x02a00000 0x400000>, <0x028c3400 0x400>;
		interrupt-names = "rx_005", "rx_057";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 324 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <GIC_SPI 327 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};

	pmmc: pmmc {
		[...]
		mbox-names = "rx", "tx";
		# RX queue ID is 5, proxy ID is 2
		# TX queue ID is 0, proxy ID is 0
		mboxes= <&msgmgr 5 2>,
			<&msgmgr 0 0>;
		[...]
	};

Example(AM654):
------------

	secure_proxy: secure_proxy@32c00000 {
		compatible = "ti,am654-secure-proxy";
		#mbox-cells = <1>;
		reg-names = "target_data", "rt", "scfg";
		reg = <0x0 0x32c00000 0x0 0x100000>,
		      <0x0 0x32400000 0x0 0x100000>,
		      <0x0 0x32800000 0x0 0x100000>;
		interrupt-names = "rx_011";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 32 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};

	dmsc: dmsc {
		[...]
		mbox-names = "rx", "tx";
		# RX Thread ID is 11
		# TX Thread ID is 13
		mboxes= <&secure_proxy 11>,
			<&secure_proxy 13>;
		[...]
	};
