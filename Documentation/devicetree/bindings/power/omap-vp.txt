Voltage Controller driver for Texas Instruments OMAP SoCs

Voltage Controller Properties:
The following are the properties of the voltage controller node
Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be one of:
  - "ti,omap3-vp" - for OMAP3 family of devices
  - "ti,omap4-vp" - for OMAP4 family of devices
  - "ti,omap5-vp" - for OMAP5 family of devices
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
  - "base-address"	- contains base address of VP module
  - "int-address"	- contains base address of interrupt register for VP module
- clocks: should point to the clock node used by VC module, usually sysclk
- ti,min-micro-volts - SoC supported min operational voltage in micro-volts
- ti,max-micro-volts - SoC supported max operational voltage in micro-volts
- ti,min-step-micro-volts - SoC supported min operational voltage steps in micro-volts
- ti,max-step-micro-volts - SoC supported max operational voltage steps in micro-volts
- ti,tranxdone-status-mask: Mask to the int-register to write-to-clear mask
	indicating VP has completed operation in sending command to Voltage Controller.
- ti,vc-channel - phandle to the Voltage Controller Channel device used by this Voltage
	Processor.
Example:
vp_mpu: vp@0x4a307b58 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-vp";

	reg = <0x4a307b58 0x18>, <0x4A306014 0x4>;
	reg-names = "base-address", "int-address";
	ti,tranxdone-status-mask=<0x20>;

	clocks = <&sysclk_in>;

	ti,vc-channel = <&vc_mpu>;
	ti,min-step-micro-volts = <10000>;
	ti,max-step-micro-volts = <50000>;
	ti,min-micro-volts = <750000>;
	ti,max-micro-volts = <1410000>;
};
