Voltage Controller driver for Texas Instruments OMAP SoCs

Voltage Controller Properties:
The following are the properties of the voltage controller node
Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be one of:
  - "ti,omap3-vc" - for OMAP3 family of devices
  - "ti,omap4-vc" - for OMAP4 family of devices
  - "ti,omap5-vc" - for OMAP5 family of devices
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
  - "base-address"	- contains base address of VC module
- clocks: should point to the clock node used by VC module, usually sysclk
- ti,i2c-clk-scl-low: is mandatory if ti,i2c-pad-load is not used. contains
  hex to represent timing for slow I2C phase low clock time.
- ti,i2c-clk-scl-high: is mandatory if ti,i2c-pad-load is not used. contains
  hex to represent timing for slow I2C phase high clock time.
- ti,i2c-clk-hsscl-low: is mandatory if ti,i2c-pad-load is not used and
  ti,i2c-high-speed is used, contains hex to represent timing for high speed I2C
  phase low clock time.
- ti,i2c-clk-hsscl-high: is mandatory if ti,i2c-pad-load is not used and
  ti,i2c-high-speed is used, contains hex to represent timing for high speed I2C
  phase high clock time.
- Must contain VC channel nodes which belong to the Voltage controller.

Optional Properties:
- ti,i2c-high-speed: bool to indicate if VC should operate in high speed I2C
  mode.
- ti,i2c-pad-load: if ti,i2c-high-speed, then this is optional to auto load
  pre-calculated I2C clock timing configuration. This is denoted in pico-farads.
- ti,i2c-pcb-length: if ti,i2c-pad-load, then this is optional to select the
  pre-calculated I2C clock timing configuration. default of '63' is used.
  This is denoted in millimeters.
- pinctrl: Most OMAP SoCs do not allow pinctrl option to select VC's I2C path.
  it is usually hardcoded by default. Define "default" pinctrl-0 as needed.

Voltage Controller Channel Properties:
The following are the properties of the voltage controller channel nodes
Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be one of:
  - ti,omap3-vc-channel-0 - Channel 0 on OMAP3 family of devices
  - ti,omap3-vc-channel-1 - Channel 1 on OMAP3 family of devices
  - ti,omap4-vc-channel-mpu - Channel MPU on OMAP4 family of devices
  - ti,omap4-vc-channel-iva - Channel IVA on OMAP4 family of devices
  - ti,omap4-vc-channel-core - Channel CORE on OMAP4 family of devices
  - ti,omap5-vc-channel-mpu - Channel MPU on OMAP5 family of devices
  - ti,omap5-vc-channel-mm - Channel MM on OMAP5 family of devices
  - ti,omap5-vc-channel-core - Channel CORE on OMAP5 family of devices
- ti,master-channel: bool to mark the "master channel". Only ONE channel is
  to be marked as master channel depending on SoC specification.

Optional Properties:
- ti,retention-micro-volts: retention voltage for the voltage controller in
  micro-volts
- ti,off-micro-volts: OFF mode voltage for the voltage controller in micro-volts
- ti,use-master-slave-addr: available only for a "non-master" channel. This
  indicates the the channel will use master channel's slave address. Usually
  used when the PMIC has the same slave address for all SMPSs.
- ti,use-master-voltage-reg-addr: available only for a "non-master" channel.
  channel will use voltage register of the master channel to send voltage
  commands - usually used in "ganged" voltage rail configuration - NOTE: this
  is useful only when doing voltage transitions alone and not using AVS.
- ti,use-master-command-reg-addr: available only for a "non-master" channel.
  channel will use command register of the master channel to send command
  values - usually used in "ganged" voltage rail configuration - NOTE: this
  is useful only when doing voltage transitions alone and not using AVS.
- ti,use-master-command-reg-val: available only for a "non-master" channel.
  channel will use command value of the master channel to send commands
  - usually used in "ganged" voltage rail configuration - NOTE: this
  is useful only when doing voltage transitions alone and not using AVS.

Example:
SoC file: (example from OMAP4)
vc: vc@0x4A307B88 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-vc";
		clocks = <&sysclk_in>;
		reg = <0x4A307B88 0x40>;
		reg-names = "base-address";

		vc_mpu: vc_mpu {
			compatible = "ti,omap4-vc-channel-mpu";
			ti,master-channel;
			ti,retention-micro-volts = <750000>;
			ti,off-micro-volts = <0>;
		};

		vc_iva: vc_iva {
			compatible = "ti,omap4-vc-channel-iva";
			ti,retention-micro-volts = <750000>;
			ti,off-micro-volts = <0>;
		};

		vc_core: vc_core {
			compatible = "ti,omap4-vc-channel-core";
			ti,retention-micro-volts = <750000>;
			ti,off-micro-volts = <0>;
		};
	};
