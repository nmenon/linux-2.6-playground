Texas Instruments K3 Multicore SoC architecture device tree bindings
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Boards based on K3 Multicore SoC architecture shall have the following property:
- compatible: Every hardware block introduced in K3 Multicore SoC
  architecture shall be of the form:
  "ti,XXX-YYY", where:
     'XXX' represents the specific SoC part for which the support is added.
     'YYY' represents the corresponding peripheral in SoC being supported.

  NOTE: Generic devices such as GIC or legacy devices shall use the specified
  compatible for those devices.

  Example:
    compatible = "ti,am654-i2c";

SoCs
-------------------------------------------

Each device tree root node must specify which exact SoC in K3 Multicore SoC
architecture it uses, using one of the following compatible values:

- AM654
  compatible = "ti,am654";

Boards
-------------------------------------------

In addition, each device tree root node must specify which one or more
of the following board-specific compatible values:

- AM654 EVM
  compatible = "ti,am654-evm", "ti,am654";
